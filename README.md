### Focus timer features:



Dynamic icon control:

- I used the "running" classes to control the display os icons according to the state of the timer.

Dynamic styling of buttons:

- I applied styles to the secondary color of the elements and used the :not selector in CSS to remove buttons from the screen based on certain classes.

accessibility of the buttons:

- I used accessibility to the application's buttons, allowing other users with disabilities to easily interact with them.

Event Listeners for clicks:

- I used the addEventListener method to add click event to the buttons, which allows you to perform the appropriate actions when the buttons are pressed.
